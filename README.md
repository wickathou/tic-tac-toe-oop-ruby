<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
## Tic Tac Toe in Ruby
This is a Tic Tac Toe game, developed following the OOP paradigm and built in Ruby.
## How to play
**Read all instructions the game prompts carefully**
1. Player_1 will be prompted to select their symbol (Press 1 for X or Press 2 for O).
<div align="left"><img src="images/step1.png"></div>
2. Once Player_1 has selected their symbol player 2 will get assigned the remaining symbol by default.<br>
  Afterwards, Player_1 will be prompted to selecte their first move from a list of available choices.

4. The system will alternate turns between players while it prints out the selected positions on the board.<br>
   Make sure that the position you select is available. Otherwise it will throw an error!

5. The game will come to a stop if there is a WIN or a DRAW. A WIN can be reached by having the same symbol appear <br>
   3 positions in a row either diagonally, horizontally or vertically. Otherwise, it's considered a TIE/DRAW!

   a new instance of the game will be started.
